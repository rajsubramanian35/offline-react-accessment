Please refer to demo.mov file in solution folder

# Choices made
1. Added "Select a country" option to locations dropdown. This is added to improve the default user experience avoiding assigning a default country for the user.
2. Imporved button labels to better understand the purpose of the buttons
3. Sorted the country list form the mock api. Sorting the list improves the user experience, by giving the user an opportunity to guesss where his/her country will be in the list
4.Show both error and success message instead of just the error message as given in the mockup. Showing a success message to user is rewarding to the user when they completed the task of picking an available username
4. Icons are added to error and success message for visual treat.
5. Lables for all the form controls are added to improve the app's a11y score.

# Todo
1. On click of clear button, ask confirmation before clearing the table
2. Add test cases to avoid undiscovered bugs.
